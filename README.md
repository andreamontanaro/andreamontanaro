### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Andrea Montanaro and I'm a Full Stack Developer from Italy.
I have experience in .NET, ReactJS and React-based Frameworks like NextJS.
I also worked with Angular a little bit.
Feel free to ask me anything about web development or programming in general! I would be very happy to reply you! :)

See you on the Internet!
